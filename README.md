# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync Issue in iOS Simulator

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using `expo-web-browser`'s `openBrowserAsync` function within an iOS simulator. The function consistently returns an empty result object, preventing proper handling of the browser interaction.

## Bug Description
The `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` function, intended to open a URL in the system's default browser, fails to return the expected result in the iOS simulator environment.  This makes it difficult to determine if the URL opened successfully or encountered any errors.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on an iOS simulator using Expo Go.
3. Observe the console output; it will always display an empty object {}.

## Expected Behavior
The function should return a result object containing information about the browser interaction, similar to the behavior observed on a physical device or Android simulator.

## Solution
The solution involves using a different approach to handle external URL opening.  Instead of relying on `expo-web-browser`, use the built-in Linking library provided by React Native. This is a more reliable solution for accessing external URLs across various platforms and simulators.
